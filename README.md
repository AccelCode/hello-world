# hello-world
Hello World. First GitHub repository/project. 

I am a pretty new coder and I am going to get into Python, Java, and C++ over the summer (in that order). Hopefully I will be able to achieve these goals, but first I want to become very fluent in Python before continuing on to the rest of the languages. This was written on April 9, 2016. It's lit.
